description = [[Color coded strategic icons with integrated unit overlays. Player color is shown as a surrounding glow, middle is colored based on unit class with same colors as range circles. Icon size indicates unit HP/threat level. Submersible units have pointy bottom, hover units has pointy top. This makes it easy to determine what composition an army has even at a glance. Overlays for idle engineers/SACU, factories, upgrading structures, and TML/SML/SMD missile count. 
BETA: Many structures don't have a 'selected' icon yet and will fall back to Redux icons when selected. Totally functional. 
Check the FAF forum thread for images and let me know what you think.
Requires UI Mod Tool (v12 tested) for overlays. Optimized for 2560x1440.]]
