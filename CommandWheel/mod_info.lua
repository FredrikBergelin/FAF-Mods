description = [[Provides 'Wheel' interface to reduce amount of key bindings and simplify several ingame actions

Setup:
Open 'Key Bindings' -> search for 'Command Wheel' -> Specify key for particular wheel -> Press and hold selected key
Open 'Option' -> 'Interface' -> search for 'Command Wheel: Trigger' -> Select key trigger that suits your needs or leave default

Wheels:
Util - interface with few useful utils and unit selections (See 'README.md' in mod folder for more details)
Alert - interface for pings
AlertExtended - interface for pings with 4 prebuilt markers
TargetPriority - interface with limited target priorities (!require 'Advanced Target Priorities' mod!)
TargetPriorityExtended - interface with target priorities (!require 'Advanced Target Priorities' mod!)

Notes:
- TargetPriority and TargetPriorityExtended wheels require 'Advanced Target Priorities' mod
- Alert and AlertExtended wheels works better when bind to non-character key due to a bug with marker
- See 'README.md' in mod folder for more details. Can be opened with any text editor.

Changelog v4:
- Fixed UI scaling handling and crashes for 4k resolution. Thanks to Frozen_byte for troubleshooting.
- Fixed a bug with ping position
- Added 'Trigger' setting to change the way of opening wheels
Changelog v6:
- Fixed resource sharing feature
