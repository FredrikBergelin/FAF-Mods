description = [[Adds a decal based on distance and firing randomness to display overall spread of damage when the attack radius decal is shown.
The estimate works best for high arc artillery. Low arc weapons generally have a smaller and less circular spread than shown.
It adds the damage radius on top of the firing randomness, so the shown range is what can be damaged, not where projectiles can land (that radius is smaller).]]
