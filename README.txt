How I install Supcom, FAF, all my mods and solve problems arising with my Macbook Pro 16 (2019, base version) running bootcamp.

1. Install Supeme Commander Forged Alliance from Steam
2. Install FAF: faf_windows-x64_2024_5_0.exe
3. Start a custom game to test and let FAF download all the necessary files
4. Move/Delete the two music files from SteamLib\steamapps\common\Supreme Commander Forged Alliance\sounds Music.xsb, Music.xwb. Otherwise my game crashes randomly after about 45 min.
5. Run the FAF_process.ahk AutoHotkey script (Not sure if it makes any difference)
6. Run the FAF_WinCtrl.ahk AutoHotkey script. It turns your left windows key (command key on mac) to ctrl, so you dont accidentally tab out and also easier to reach.
7. Download mods, activate them



Mod ideas:

- Pauser
    - Hotkeys to pause and unpause everything that drains energy. Construction, abilities, and weapon fire stance when requiring energy.
    - Use this in my other mods as a dependency,. 

Mods todo:

- Color Coded Strategic Icons
    - Finish structures
    - Set common middle parts, for example splash damage is horizontal line, missiles are vertical line
    - Add more individual icons wherever necessary. Lightning tank? 
- Shields deactivates on CapsLock AND on shift-CapsLock and must be manually activated.
- Pausing / Auto-pausing artillery should put them into no fire stance, its the only way to halt their energy use. Both CapsLock and UI-party ECOntrol
- ECOntrol
    - Update icons
        - "nuke_category" is used for all missiles, split or merge?
    - Subcategories? Expandable?
    - Show all from start, so they can be configured during early game as well
    - Add more modes: Pause, AutoPause, Prioritize, ... ?
    - Exenditure should scale with the highest one filling the bar, others sized based on how they differ from that one.
