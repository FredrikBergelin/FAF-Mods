How I install Supcom, FAF, all my mods and solve problems arising with my Macbook Pro 16 (2019, base version) running bootcamp.

1. Install Supeme Commander Forged Alliance from Steam
2. Install FAF: faf_windows-x64_2024_5_0.exe
3. Start a custom game to test and let FAF download all the necessary files
4. Move/Delete the two music files from SteamLib\steamapps\common\Supreme Commander Forged Alliance\sounds Music.xsb, Music.xwb. Otherwise my game crashes randomly after about 45 min.
5. Run the FAF_process.ahk AutoHotkey script (Not sure if it makes any difference)
6. Run the FAF_WinCtrl.ahk AutoHotkey script. It turns your left windows key (command key on mac) to ctrl, so you dont accidentally tab out and also easier to reach.
7. Download mods, activate them





Mods todo:

- Shields deactivates on CapsLock AND on shift-CapsLock and must be manually activated.
- Pausing / Auto-pausing artillery should put them into no fire stance, its the only way to preserve their energy use. Both CapsLock and UI-party ECOntrol
-
